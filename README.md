# Trouble In MC Town

This Minecraft datapack provides a new implementation of the well known Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) mod.


### Contents

In total, the datapack provides:
1. Implementation of the TTT rules, dividing players into <span style="color:blue">**Innocent**</span> and <span style="color:blue">**Traitor**</span>. Innocents win if they stay alive for 8 minutes (configurable) or all Traitors are dead. Traitors win if all Innocents are dead before the 8 minutes are over.
2. All players can find loot by opening (empty) chests around the world (best used with a pre-generated level, more coming soon). Traitors who wander around the world far away from the Innocents can find extra fun Traitor-loot
3. Special Traitor-loot containing these special items:
  * Diamond armor and weapons
  * Enchanted Golden Apples
  * Arrows with special effects, like lightning or TNT explosions. This is an adaption of Cloud Wolf's "Custom Arrows in Minecraft" Tutorial which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14mBKL53Fy0)
  * Splash Potions which can be thrown to summon mobs
4. A start structure which allows easy access to the TTT game
